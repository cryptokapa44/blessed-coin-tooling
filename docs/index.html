    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-amber-100/90 mb-6">
      Born in the depths of the trenches, <strong>Blessed Coin</strong> was forged to heal, not to hype.
      It is the light that refuses to fade — a beacon for those who still believe in faith, brotherhood, and redemption
      amidst the chaos of the Solana markets.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-amber-100/90 mb-6">
      This coin is not a promise of riches, but a reminder of <em>belief</em>. A signal for the soldiers who still hold the line.
      When the noise fades, the Blessed Coin will remain — a lighthouse in the trenches, a faith index for the fallen and the faithful alike.
